# Student Performance Insights ðŸ“Š

## Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Student Performance Dataset.  
The objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between student demographics, academic behavior, and final academic performance.

## Dataset Details
- **Dataset:** student-mat.csv (Math course data)
- **Records:** 395 students
- **Attributes:** 33 features
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## EDA Process
- Data loading and preliminary inspection
- Data cleaning and checking for missing values
- Statistical summary and feature exploration
- Visualization of feature distributions and relationships
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps and pairplots
- Insight extraction and summary of findings

## Key Findings
- Female students slightly outperform male students in final grades.
- Increased study time generally correlates with higher academic performance.
- Students who aspire to pursue higher education tend to achieve better grades.
- Previous term grades (G1 and G2) are strong predictors of the final grade (G3).

## Project Structure
- `Student-Performance-Insights.ipynb` â€” Jupyter Notebook containing the complete EDA process and visualizations.
- `Student-Performance-Insights.pdf` â€” Exported PDF report summarizing the analysis.

## How to Run
1. Ensure the dataset `student-mat.csv` is available in the working directory.
2. Open `Student-Performance-Insights.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Execute all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
